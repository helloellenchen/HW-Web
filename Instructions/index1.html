            In this analysis, you'll be experinceing the visualization for the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. The main objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

			Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
			Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
		    Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
			Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

        </p>

        <p>
            In order to edit your own code using Brackets, you can just open the folder containing your files.
            Brackets treats the currently open folder as a "project"; features like Code Hints, Live Preview and
            Quick Edit only use files within the currently open folder.

            Once you're ready to get out of this sample project and edit your own code, you can use the dropdown
            in the left sidebar to switch folders. Right now, the dropdown says "Getting Started" - that's the
            folder containing the file you're looking at right now. Click on the dropdown and choose "Open Folderâ€¦"
            to open your own folder.
            You can also use the dropdown later to switch back to folders you've opened previously, including this
