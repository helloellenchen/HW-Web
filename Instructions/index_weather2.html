            In this analysis, you'll be experinceing the visualization for the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. The main objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

        <h3>Projects Design: <br/>
            Randomly select **at least** 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude to perform a weather checkr on each of cities.  </h3>
        <p>
            In order for traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

            Now, we know what you may be thinking: "Duh. It gets hotter..."  <br/>

            But, if pressed, how would you prove it? <br/>
